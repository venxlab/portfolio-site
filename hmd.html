					<h2 class='pfblock-header'>The Brief</h2>
					<p>
					  <a href="https://www.hiremedirect.com" target='_blank'>Hire Me Direct</a>
						came to us for help in improving a pre-existing digital experience where contractors providing A/V services could connect with A/V freelancers that would help in carrying out large event contracts.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our assignment was to optimize the buyer portal experience, whereby a contractor could search, hire, manage and pay a freelancer should they fit the criteria for the job.</p>
					<br>
					<h3 class='pfblock-title'>Our Approach</h3>
					<p>
						Our approach was to start exploring the analog domains of event planning and A/V services. In understanding how key players in the domain operate, we would then be able to pick the appropriate models that solve these analog pain points.

				<div class="col-md-4 insights-container-image">
					<h3>Interviews and Affinity Mapping</h3>
					<p>
						We asked our client for SME contacts, whom we consulted for their knowledge on the target user, and their ability to provide contacts for initial user interviews. After gaining a better idea of the target user profile, we were able to source more interviewees from our personal networks. We took the insights from our interviews to create a task model of the contractor's journey. Furthermore, we performed a market analysis of the A/V freelancing space to get a better idea of Hire Me Direct’s competitors. We used the combined insights from our research to create target user groups.

					<h3>The Problem</h3>

						A/V service contractors lack adequate tools to find skilled sub-contractors and manage the projects they put them on.

					<h3>Shaping the solution with product values</h3>

					<p>
						As a first step in shaping our solution, we established a core set of product values. Product values ensure that any decision made in regards to the product (from features, content structure and copy to layout, color and typeface) align themselves to the core needs of the target user and the overarching problem trying to be solved.
					</p>

					<p>
						The product values we created in this specific instance sprouted from our insights on the needs and frustrations of the inexperienced contractor and sub-contractor.
					</p>
	
					<br>
					
					<p><span>Growth</span></p>
					<p>
						Hire Me Direct need to scale to a larger audience and acquire 10 more technicians in 10 major cities. This platform could start that conversation and grow to a scale beyond those limitations.
					</p>

					<br>
				

					<p><span>Accessibility</span></p>
					<p>
						Anybody from various skill levels should be able to use the site, work among their circles, attain new skills and grow their own freelance business.
					</p>

					<br>

					<p><span>Opportunity</span></p>
					<p>
						 Low level technicians now have the opportunity to work on a platform that caters to their industry and grow their own circle of contacts.
					</p>

					<br>

					<p><span>Trust</span></p>
					<p>
						 Clients won't use this service unless they can advocate it’s value by establishing; trust transparency and open communication with their technicians.
					</p>

					<br>

					<p><span>Selectiveness</span></p>

						The selective vetting process reinforces the ability to get the best professional technicians in the field and ensure a quality product.

					<h3>Moving Forward</h3>
					
					<br>

					<p>
						<span>Adopting the Venmo model for creating payment-based network</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						Contractors currently on the site use it to avoid legal overhead in processing payments. Furthermore, they require their subcontractors to create an account on the site in order to pay them. These same contractors will only hire people that they have either previously worked with, or someone that has been vouched for by a party they trust; assuming that party has worked with said subcontractor in the past.
					</p>

					<p>
						Given that a financial transaction between these parties can be used as proof of work, much like Venmo, we can leverage the financial transactions occurring on the site as proof of two parties having interacted with each other, and start building a tiered network of professionals based on whom they have worked with in the past. This makes professionals easily discoverable while also settling the ever-prevalent trust issues around working with a subcontractor whom a hiring contractor has not yet had direct professional contact with.
					</p>

					<br>

					<p>
						<span>Adopting an Uber model for location-based discoverability of service technicians</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						Situations of needing to hire a technician the day of an event are par for the course in this industry. In these situations, proximity to the venue plays a large part in the time and travel cost it takes for a subcontractor hired the day of an event to reach the venue and perform the task they were hired for. Very few subcontractors take a job where the travel costs exceed the compensation they receive for the job. 
					</p>

					<p>
						This can easily be solved by leveraging the Uber model for location-based service discoverability, where a client enters their criteria and the system finds the nearest service provider that accepts the request.

					<h2 class='pfblock-header'>Final Thoughts</h2>

					<p>
						In wrapping up this project, we learned a lot about working within the technical constraints of a pre-existing platform, development constraints of what was technically feasible, and the value in being able to communicate design concepts to a client. In speaking to the final constraint, gained a better understanding in how to step outside the boilerplate UX process everyone learns, and crafting deliverables that bypass the ambiguity many clients experience on the receiving end of being presented with such deliverables.
					</p>

					<h3>What is a deliverable?</h3>
					
					<p>
						The purpose of a deliverable is to enhance the quality of knowledge transfer between two parties. In that respect, the presentation of that knowledge can take many forms, and there is no “correct” way to create a journey map, persona, mental model, etc. Ultimately, the inclusion or exclusion of the information presented (along with the visual representation of that information) is driven by who the information is being communicated to and what they value.
