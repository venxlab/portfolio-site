								<p>
								  <a href="https://www.hiremedirect.com" target='_blank'>Hire Me Direct</a>
									came to us for help in improving a pre-existing digital experience where contractors providing A/V services could connect with A/V freelancers that would help in carrying out large event contracts.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>
							
						<div class="">
							<h2 class='pfblock-header'>The Challenge</h2>
							<div class="h2-subheader">
								<p>
									Our assignment was to optimize the buyer portal experience, whereby a contractor could search, hire, manage and pay a freelancer should they fit the criteria for the job.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class=''>
							<h2 class='pfblock-header'>Our Approach</h2>
							<div class="h2-subheader">
								<p>
									Our approach was to start exploring the analog domains of event planning and A/V services. By understanding how key players in the domain operated, we were able to pick the appropriate models that solved their analog pain points.

						<h3>Interviews and Affinity Mapping</h3>
						<p>
							We asked our client for SME contacts, whom we consulted for their knowledge on the target user, and their ability to provide contacts for initial user interviews. After gaining a better idea of the target user profile, we were able to source more interviewees from our personal networks.
						</p>

						<h3>Key Insights</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Experienced contractors have established networks of trusted freelancers
							</li>
							<li>
								Inexperienced contractors have not yet established their networks and tend to use online resources like <a href="http://crewspace.com/">Crewspace</a>.
							</li>
							<li>
								A freelancer's location weighs heavily when looking to hire on short notice
							</li>
							<li>
								Current users of the service do not use it for it’s intended purpose of “finding the right guy” but rather use it to process payments in order to avoid the hassle of dealing with legal paperwork

							 	<strong>Through our interviews,</strong> we learned that <b>referrals are everything</b> in this industry.

							<h3>Task Model</h3>
							<p>
								Originally stemming from a whiteboarding session, the task model we created allowed us to visualize the contractor's process and identify potential off ramps in their journey. In order to communicate our understanding of the contractor's process to our client, we turned our whiteboard diagram into a high fidelity deliverable.
							</p>


							<h3>Key Insights</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Off ramps are abundant when contractors fail to source freelancers from within their network
								</li>
								<li>
									A rental house or online resource (like Crewspace) is only referenced after all avenues of contacts have been closed

					<h3>Moving Forward</h3>
					
					<br>

					<p>
						<span>Adopting the Venmo model for creating payment-based network</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						Contractors currently on the site use it to avoid legal overhead in processing payments. Furthermore, they require their subcontractors to create an account on the site in order to pay them. These same contractors will only hire people that they have either previously worked with, or someone that has been vouched for by a party they trust; assuming that party has worked with said subcontractor in the past.
					</p>

					<p>
						Given that a financial transaction between these parties can be used as proof of work, much like Venmo, we can leverage the financial transactions occurring on the site as proof of two parties having interacted with each other, and start building a tiered network of professionals based on whom they have worked with in the past. This makes professionals easily discoverable while also settling the ever-prevalent trust issues around working with a subcontractor whom a hiring contractor has not yet had direct professional contact with.
					</p>

					<br>

					<p>
						<span>Adopting an Uber model for location-based discoverability of service technicians</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						Situations of needing to hire a technician the day of an event are par for the course in this industry. In these situations, proximity to the venue plays a large part in the time and travel cost it takes for a subcontractor hired the day of an event to reach the venue and perform the task they were hired for. Very few subcontractors take a job where the travel costs exceed the compensation they receive for the job. 
					</p>

					<p>
						This can easily be solved by leveraging the Uber model for location-based service discoverability, where a client enters their criteria and the system finds the nearest service provider that accepts the request.
					</p>

					<h2 class='pfblock-header'>Final Thoughts</h2>

					<p>
						In wrapping up this project, we learned a lot about working within the technical constraints of a pre-existing platform, development constraints of what was technically feasible, and the value in being able to communicate design concepts to a client. In speaking to the final constraint, gained a better understanding in how to step outside the boilerplate UX process everyone learns, and crafting deliverables that bypass the ambiguity many clients experience on the receiving end of being presented with such deliverables.
					</p>

					<h3>What is a deliverable?</h3>
					
					<p>
						The purpose of a deliverable is to enhance the quality of knowledge transfer between two parties. In that respect, the presentation of that knowledge can take many forms, and there is no “correct” way to create a journey map, persona, mental model, etc. Ultimately, the inclusion or exclusion of the information presented (along with the visual representation of that information) is driven by who the information is being communicated to and what they value.
