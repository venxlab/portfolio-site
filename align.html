					<h2>The Brief</h2>
					<p>In October 2015, The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission voted to approve the final rules permitting companies to offer and sell securities through online equity crowdfunding. Small and medium-sized startups with limited access to high stakes investors could now raise capital for their enterprises by offering equity to anyone, rich or poor, accredited or unaccredited. 
					</p>
					<p>Our assignment was to create an online crowdfunding platform for start-ups, where any entrepreneur can post their business idea or existing business and raise money.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Our Approach</h3>
					<p>Given that this was a concept project, we first had to educate ourselves on the startup and crowdfunding spaces. We decided to explore some preliminary domain research. With the insights from our research, we were able to generate insights that we could further validate through user interviews and surveys.

					<h3 class="pfblock-title">understanding the domain</h3>

					<br>

					<p>Our first step was to gather all the information we could find on the startup, crowdfunding and legislation domains. identifying the overlaps and impact of new legislation on the crowdfunding space was key in how our product would shape. in our first attempt at doing real domain research, we had no idea where to start. we were overwhelmed by the broadness of scope and by the idea that we had to become “experts” in all these fields within 48 hours.</p>

					<p>We started by combing through the <a href='https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-249.html'>Title III legislation</a> and related articles that described its impact on crowdfunding. using this knowledge as a jumping off point, we asked our visual designer, justin (who had prior experience in trading) to give us a crash course in equity and investments. leveraging his network of investment professionals and my own network of startup founders, we were able to round up candidates to interview as subject matter experts in order to gain first hand knowledge into the domain.</p>

					<p>The professionals we interviewed had an average of 10 years experience in the field, and were further able to point to credible articles in <a href='http://fundersandfounders.com/how-funding-works-splitting-equity/'>startup funding</a>, <a href='http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/25162'>investor strategy</a>, and <a href='http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/250355'>crowdfunding</a>.</p>

					<h3>Key Insights</h3>

						<ul>
						<li>
							The basic idea behind equity is the splitting of a pie. When you start something, your pie is really small. When you take outside investment and your company grows, your pie becomes bigger.  
						</li>
						<li>
							Trust and track record play a huge role in this industry. Startups look for investors that can provide more than just financial support. Investors with experience in the industry and deep professional networks are preferred.
						</li>
						<li>
							Funding portals can curate and vet companies subjectively.
						</li>
						<li>People with less than $1 million in net worth or $200,000 per year in income are allowed to make equity-crowdfunding investments.</li>
						<li>
							Rewards-based crowdfunders lack the key expertise for managing an equity-crowdfunding platform
						</li>

					<h3 class="pfblock-title">understanding the market</h3>
					<br>
					<p>We needed to gain a better understanding of the current crowdfunding landscape; what services already exist and where opportunities exist for disruption. Much like the domain research, we stumbled a few times on getting started. Given the vast amount of information we had accumulated during our domain research phase, we had difficulty visualizing where all the competitors lay in relation to one another.</p>

					<p>As a first step, we organized our data by putting together a feature comparison chart of successful features and weaknesses across existing platforms in the crowdfunding space. The trends we saw from our feature comparison chart were pooled to create a SWOT analysis, and eventually a competitive market analysis chart, which gave us the visual insight we were looking for in where our competitors lie, and where we could make the greatest impact.</p>

					<h3>Key Insights</h3>

						<ul>
						<li>
							Many crowdfunding services cater to accredited investors and lean closer towards rewards based compensation.
						</li>
						<li>
							The closest competition that offers equity crowdfunding to non-accredited investors is Seedrs, and since that service does not currently extend outside of the UK, there is an opportunity for disruption of a similar capacity here in the US.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Understanding the users</h3>

					<p>Our domain research left us with many unanswered questions and unvalidated assumptions. We needed answers from real users in order to validate our assumptions and answer our follow-up domain research questions.</p>

					<p>We decided to conduct user research as a means to understand the lifestyles and motivations of real users targeted to use the system. With a wide variety of research tools and methods at our disposal, we had to focus the scope and choose the best methods that would harvest the most insight in the shortest amount of time. We created a research plan outlining the research methods we found appropriate. The plan itself struck a good balance between quantitative and qualitative research methods.</p>
				
				</div>
			
			</div>

			<div class='row'>
			

				<div class='col-md-6 fadeInUp'>

					<h3>Quantitative research</h3>

					<p>Our primary goal with quantitative research was to answer broad sweeping questions pertaining to our target users’ investment practices</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							What are current investment practices of the demographic that the Title III ruling is geared towards?
						</li>
						<li>
							What do they value and how do they go about finding that information? (channels, touch-points, etc.)
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The struggle was finding an appropriate research method with which we could cast a large net and gather insights in a short amount of time. To achieve this, we designed a 10-question survey that asked users about their current investment practices, knowledge of the startup world, and experience with crowdfunding platforms. This was blasted across various social media channels and our personal networks to achieve the largest sample size possible.</p>

					<h3>Key Insights</h3>

						<ul>
						<li>
							94% have never invested as an angel investor

							88% have never invested during the friends and family round
						</li>
						<li>
							Only 12% choose to invest in startups
						</li>
						<li>
							71% choose to invest in stocks/options
						</li>
						<li>
							Our original assumption of the assumed awareness of opportunity people thought they had was invalidated. Our survey indicated that users were not aware of these investment opportunities or how to take advantage of them. A certain degree of education would be necessary.

				<div class='col-md-6 fadeInUp'>

					<h3>User interviews</h3>

					<p>Our qualitative research focused on gaining insight into how users actually felt about crowdfunding and where their emotional reluctancies lie in buying into such a system. While we had an idea of the questions we wanted to ask, we anticipated the search for the “ideal” user would be difficult considering we didn’t quite know what the ideal user looked like. To circumvent this speed bump, we decided ahead of time to include a question on our survey asking if participants would be interested in participating in further research. Once we had a rough idea of the demographic background of the majority of the survey respondents, we were able to consult this list and our personal networks to source potential interview candidates.</p>

				<div class="col-md-12 pfblock-gray key-insights-container fadeInUp">
					
					<h3>Key Insights</h3>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Of the two investor groups, experienced users are completely turned off to the idea of crowdfunding. They find the idea impersonal, and would rather navigate through backchannels of their established offline networks to gain insights into lucrative investment opportunities.
						</li>
						<li>
							Inexperienced investors buy into the story over stats. They want to feel like they are part of a bigger community, that their money is doing something positive for that community, and seek validation from that larger community on decisions they have made.
						</li>
						<li>
							Inexperienced investors are intimidated by the idea of investing and the terms associated with it
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Synthesizing user research</h3>

					<p>Our goal now was synthesize and understand all our insights from our user interviews. Much like our competitive market analysis, we had a lot of information, but no visual representation of our findings for our own understanding and communication purposes. Our first step was to identify and summarize broad trends in our interviews. We then built off these summaries and created proto-personas that we could align ourselves to throughout the duration of the project. For each persona, we made sure to call out their respective user goals, frustrations and motivations. These deliverables would also come in handy when communicating our research findings to interested parties outside of our team.</p>
